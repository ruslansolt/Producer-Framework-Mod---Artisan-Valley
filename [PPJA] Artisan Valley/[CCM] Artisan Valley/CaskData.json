// Each line is a configuration done with an "identifier" and an "aging rate".
// Identifiers can be an object's Id, an object's Category or an object's Name.
// To calculate the amount of days it take to age an object, divide 56 by the aging rate. That's the number of days to age from no quality to iridium quality.
// Gold quality is half that value, and silver quality is one quarter of that value.
